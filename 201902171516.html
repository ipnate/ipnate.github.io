          <p>I moved to Cape Town, South Africa, about a year ago to take up a Job with a FinTech company that does cross border post graduate student loans. I moved from Bloemfontein, South Africa, which is technically classified as a City but if you don’t slow down on your road past Bloemfontein on the N1 high way from Cape Town to Pretoria you will pass the entire city in under 5 mins.</p>
          <p>What a change it was to come and live in the beautiful city of Cape Town! With no traffic and optimal conditions, it takes me 36 minutes to drive to work from my house on the same N1 that you pass Bloemfontein by in 5 minutes.</p>
          <p>I worked for a small software development house start up that serviced mostly UK clients, at the time of my employment, for the last 4 years before leaving Bloemfontein. We had a small team of 7 developers, and everyone was pretty much working on their own projects or jumping across projects. I was the most senior software developer in the company with the most ruby experience as well, how mis guided I was with the falsely named position…</p>
          <p>I have since learned there is so much more that goes into a role like that, more than I could have ever been exposed to in that mini city.</p>
          <p>I spent most of my life in Bloemfontein, growing up there, going to school, meeting my wife, getting married and working, never knowing how much more is out there in our country.</p>
          <p>So on the 5th of March 2018 I started my new job as a Software Engineer at Prodigy Finance in Cape Town. This being a much larger company than I have ever worked for with a large tech team and, what I have learned since then is not that many, team of about 40 software engineers.</p>
          <p>To say the least I was lost on my first day and my first week and my first month. This was the first time I was working in a SCRUM team that was responsible for a specific service with all the traditional SCRUM ceremonies.</p>
          <p>I probably spent my first month just going through architecture documentation, speaking to all the teams, understanding all the services and understanding what our service does. I would love to say that I quickly understood the intricacies of the micro service we were responsible for, but it took at least another 6 months to understand how our unique credit risk system worked.</p>
          <p>Starting this new job, I was very conscious of not letting these city people see the real me that comes from this mini city and that was overwhelmed by this big city. I wanted it to seem the I was used to this big team, big city and collaborative work environment.</p>
          <p>I soon figured out that trying to hide who I really was is the biggest mistake that I could possibly make, luckily for me I was placed in a very understanding and already matured team, which upon opening up to about these things and what I need to get better at and learn they were able to guide me towards setting goals that would later on prove instrumental in my career at Prodigy.</p>
          <p>What I learned out of this was that you should always be yourself, but still be open to learning new things and adapting where needed, but never suppressing who you really are.</p>
          <p>All of this prepared me for the inevitable scenario in any growing FinTech, which is the churn of engineers and the splitting of teams. As fate will have it, I ended up with a new team, myself with two new engineers and a new product owner on an old credit risk system, but I will tell you more about this in my next post!</p>
